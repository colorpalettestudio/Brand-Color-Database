# Deploying to Vercel

This guide explains how to deploy your Brand Color Database app to Vercel.

## Overview

Your app has been configured to work with Vercel's serverless platform. Here's what has been set up:

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`vercel.json`** - Vercel configuration file that tells Vercel how to build and deploy your app
2. **`api/index.ts`** - Serverless function handler for your Express backend (handles all `/api/*` routes)
3. **`.vercelignore`** - Files to ignore during deployment

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Import in Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect the configuration from `vercel.json`

3. **Configure Environment Variables** (if using PostgreSQL database)
   In Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables, add:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string (from Neon or other provider)
   - Any other environment variables your app needs

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy your app
   - You'll get a live URL like `https://your-app.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

## How It Works

### Frontend
- Built using Vite
- Static files served from `dist/public`
- All your React components remain unchanged

### Backend (API Routes)
- Runs as serverless functions on Vercel
- All routes under `/api/*` are handled by `api/serverless.ts`
- The serverless function initializes Express and handles requests

### Database
- If using PostgreSQL (Neon):
  - Make sure to add `DATABASE_URL` as an environment variable in Vercel
  - The app will automatically connect using the URL
- If using in-memory storage:
  - Data will reset on each deployment
  - Consider switching to a database for production

## Important Notes

### Routes
All your API routes are already prefixed with `/api`, so they'll work correctly:
- `GET /api/colors`
- `GET /api/colors/hue/:hue`
- `GET /api/colors/keyword/:keyword`
- `GET /api/colors/search?q=...`
- `POST /api/colors`
- And all other routes

### Build Process
The build command in `vercel.json` is:
```bash
npm run build
```

This runs:
1. `vite build` - Builds the React frontend
2. `esbuild server/index.ts` - Bundles the server code

### Limitations
Serverless functions have some limitations:
- **10-second timeout** on the Hobby plan (60 seconds on Pro)
- **No persistent storage** - Use a database for data persistence
- **Cold starts** - First request after inactivity may be slower

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json` (not devDependencies)
- Verify TypeScript compiles: `npm run check`

### API Routes Not Working
- Verify routes are prefixed with `/api`
- Check Function logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in Vercel environment variables
- For Neon or other PostgreSQL providers, make sure the connection string is correct
- Check if your database allows connections from Vercel's IP ranges

## Testing Locally

Before deploying, test the production build locally:

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` to test.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Push code to GitHub
2. âœ… Import project in Vercel
3. âœ… Configure environment variables
4. âœ… Deploy
5. âœ… Test your live app
6. ðŸŽ‰ Share your app with the world!
