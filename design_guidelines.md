3. **Visual Hierarchy:** Filters and search prominent but not overwhelming
4. **Performance Focused:** Smooth interactions even with 600+ colors
5. **Professional Aesthetic:** Clean, modern interface suitable for design workflows

## Images
No hero images required. This is a utility-focused application where the color swatches themselves serve as the primary visual content. Focus on clean typography and efficient layout rather than decorative imagery.
